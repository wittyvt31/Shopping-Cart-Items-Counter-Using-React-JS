The Project was Built using React JS and almost all of its libraries.

The Project is divided into two components. Actually one, and the other is the child of the first component. The Counter which is the child of Counters Component, which is finally imported in the "App.js' file, which is then rendered in "Index.js" and creates a virtual dom and actual dom. This makes us display the site by entering the command "npm start" in the terminal. 

The Cart components and rendering is done in the most efficient manner, by taking care of every funtion, memory lapeses, lifting of state, and many more to name. The Code is reduced as much as it is possible in JSX. 

The Project is similar to the cart counter used in many e-commerce websites like Flipkart, Amazon, Myntra, Ebay, etc. I haven't given a complex UI so that the watcher can understand how the counter works from the simplest aspect with fully described buttons. The CSS of the project is plain.
